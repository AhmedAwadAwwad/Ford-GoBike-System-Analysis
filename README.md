## by Ahmed Awad


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, the dataset used for this exploratory analysis consists of monthly individual trip data from January 2019 to December 2019 in CSV format covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, available here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html


## Summary of Findings

> The number of trips peaked around 8-9am and 17-18pm during a day, there were more trips on work days (Mon-Fri) compared to weekends. Summar time was the most popular season of a year, likely due to the weather. The riding trips tend to be shorter on Monday through Friday compared to weekends. It indicates a pretty stable and efficient usage of the bike sharing system on normal work days, while more casual flexible use on weekends.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Different usage pattern/habit between the two type of riders are seen from the exploration. Subscribers use the system heavily on work days i.e. Monday through Friday whereas customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon. Many trips concentrated around 8-9am and 17-18pm on work days for subscribers, yet customers tend to use more in the late afternoon around 17pm Monday to Friday. The efficient/short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for work commute. The more relaxing and flexible pattern of customer use shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system quite differently from the subscribers, heavily over weekends and in the afternoon, for city tour or leisure purpose probably.
